# 🦺 AWS Serverless PPE Detection System

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue) ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-cloud-orange) ![Serverless](https://img.shields.io/badge/serverless-yes-green) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey)

A fully serverless, event-driven Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection system built on AWS.

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to capture images and upload them to Amazon S3. Each upload triggers an AWS Lambda function that analyzes the image using Amazon Rekognition’s built-in PPE detection API. If a safety violation is detected (e.g., missing helmet or vest), the system sends a real-time alert via Amazon SNS and logs the violation in a secondary S3 bucket.

# 🚀 Architecture Overview

## System Flow

1. Raspberry Pi captures image
2. Image uploaded to S3 (Images Bucket)
3. S3 event triggers Lambda
4. Lambda:
   - Calls Rekognition `detect_protective_equipment`
   - Evaluates PPE compliance
   - Sends SNS alert if violation detected
   - Logs violation details as text file in second S3 bucket
5. Local cleanup script removes outdated objects from S3

# ⚙️ How It Works

## 1️⃣ Raspberry Pi Upload

The Raspberry Pi captures images and uploads them directly to the Images S3 bucket.

Example upload flow:

```
capture image → upload to S3 → S3 event fires
```

---

## 2️⃣ Lambda Processing

When a new image is uploaded:

- Lambda extracts the S3 object key
- Calls Rekognition PPE detection API
- Checks for missing required PPE
- Publishes SNS alert if violation detected
- Appends violation details to a text file in the violations bucket

---

## 3️⃣ Violation Logging

Violations are stored as structured text logs in S3.

Example log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2026-02-19T14:32:10Z
Image: site_camera_01_1234.jpg
Violation: Missing helmet
```

# 🧹 Cleanup Utility

The `cleanup` folder contains a local script to remove old objects from S3 buckets.

Example usage:

```bash
python delete_old_s3_objects.py --bucket images-bucket --MAX_IMAGES 50
```

This helps manage storage and maintain cost efficiency.

# 🔐 Security Considerations

- IAM roles follow least privilege principle
- No hardcoded credentials
- Environment variables used for configuration
- S3 buckets configured as private
- SNS topics restricted via IAM policies
- Lambda execution role limited to required services only

---

# 🧠 Design Decisions

- Event-driven architecture for scalability
- Fully serverless implementation
- Lightweight S3-based logging for low-frequency violations
- Modular Lambda structure for maintainability
- Separation between edge device logic and cloud processing

---

# 📈 Scalability & Improvements

Future improvements may include:

- Replacing text-based logging with DynamoDB
- Implementing Infrastructure as Code (AWS SAM / Terraform)
- Adding CI/CD pipeline for automated Lambda deployment
- Adding lifecycle policies to S3 buckets
- Implementing authentication for Raspberry Pi uploads

---

# 🛠 Deployment Notes

Required AWS resources:

- Two S3 buckets:
  - Images bucket (triggers Lambda)
  - Violations bucket (stores text logs)
- Lambda function (Python runtime)
- SNS topic (with email/SMS subscription)
- IAM role with:
  - S3 read/write access
  - Rekognition access
  - SNS publish permissions

# Success Criteria:
-PPE Detection Accuracy
The system achieves at least 70% detection accuracy when identifying whether required PPE is present or missing in test images.
-Automated Alert Notification
When a PPE violation is detected, an email alert is successfully sent via Amazon SNS within 10 seconds of image processing.
-Secure Storage of Images and Logs
100% of processed images and detection logs are stored in the Amazon S3 bucket, with access restricted to authorized users (e.g., project advisor only).
---
# MVP:
-Video Capture and Frame Processing
The system captures video input and extracts image frames for PPE compliance analysis.
-High-Speed Image Transfer with Reliable Accuracy
Captured images are transferred efficiently to the cloud while maintaining detection accuracy above the defined threshold.
-Automated Email Alerts via AWS SNS
When a PPE violation is detected, the system automatically sends an email notification to the contractor using Amazon SNS.
-Secure Storage of Images and Logs in Amazon S3
All captured images and detection logs are securely stored in an Amazon S3 bucket with controlled access permissions.
-PPE Detection Using AWS Rekognition
The system analyzes uploaded images using Amazon Rekognition to identify whether required personal protective equipment (e.g., helmets, safety vests) is present.
